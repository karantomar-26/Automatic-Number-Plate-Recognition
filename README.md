## ðŸ”¹ Features

- **License Plate Detection**: YOLOv5/v8 model trained to find plates in images/video.
- **Text Recognition**: Use of Tesseract or PaddleOCR to convert cropped plates into text.
- **Lightweight Preprocessing**: Includes resizing, grayscale conversion, thresholding, and denoising.
- **Flexible Input**: Supports single images, video files, or webcam streams.
- **Visualization**: Saves or displays bounding boxes and recognized plate text overlays.
